The floozie in the jacuzzi
The fly in the ointment
The full monty
The game is afoot
The game is up

The quick and the dead
The real McCoy
The road less travelled
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
The salt of the earth 
The seven-year itch
The shoemaker always wears the worst shoes

The Yellow Peril
There is more than one way to kill a cat
There are three kinds of lies... 
There but for the grace of God, go I
There is no alternative
There's an R in the month
There's method in my madness
There's no fool like an old fool
There's no place like home
There's no such thing as a free lunch (Tanstaafl)
There's no such thing as bad publicity
There's one (a sucker) born every minute
There's one law for the rich and another law for the poor

Three score and ten
Three sheets to the wind
Three strikes and you are out

Throw in the towel
Throw good money after bad
Throw your hat into the ring
Thumbs up
Thus far into the bowels of the land
Ticked off
Tickle the ivories
Tickled pink

Till the cows come home
Time and tide wait for no man
Tinker's damn
Tilting at windmills
Tissue of lies
Titfer
Tit for tat 
Tits up
To a T
To all intents and purposes
To be or not to be, that is the question
To beggar belief
To boldly go where no man has gone before
To boot
To cast the first stone
To err is human; to forgive divine
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub
To the manner born
To the nth degree 
To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive

You are what you eat
You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink
You can lead a whore to culture but you can't make her think
You can't get blood out of a stone
You can't have your cake and eat it too 
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You get on my wick
You look as if you've been dragged through a hedge backwards
You'll wonder where the yellow went when you brush your teeth with Pepsodent
Young turk
Your days are numbered
Your money or your life
Your name is mud
You've never had it so good
Zero tolerance
